# Hashing
A hash function is a function that takes an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, typically a number, is called the hash code or hash value. The main purpose of a hash function is to efficiently map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, which are often used as indexes in hash tables.
